Disclaimer: I got the concept of this website from a YouTube video. While implementing it, I followed the video as well as wrote my own code.

-Design a social network website front-page using tools from Bootstrap-4
- Used fixed-nav, form, modals, flexbox classes
- Made the page mobile friendly using bootstrap
- And smooth scrolling using JavaScript
